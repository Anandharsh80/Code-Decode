While using the Script as a Module or while running the Console, the following points should be kept in mind:

1. Avoid converting a .PNG file to .JPG or .JPEG files, as they can't be assigned RGBA values.

2. Since not all combination of values can be used as a pixel(example - (54,53,54)), the Script/Console might not work as expected in those circumstances. Hence, avoid using monochrome pictures or grayscale pictures or pictures where all the values of R, G & B are same.

3. A sample image has been uploaded to the repository for reference.
